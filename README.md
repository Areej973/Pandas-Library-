# Pandas Library Project
This project focuses on enhancing understanding of the Pandas library and developing essential data manipulation skills.

The tasks cover creating a DataFrame, exploring its properties, modifying data types, displaying specific rows, and handling missing values.

### 1. Importing the Required Libraries
The project begins by importing the Pandas and NumPy libraries, which are fundamental tools for data analysis in Python.

### 2. Creating the DataFrame
A DataFrame consisting of 15 rows and 3 columns was created.

The columns include:

Level
Course Name
Major

The DataFrame contains a mix of text, numeric values, and some null values to simulate real-world data.

### 3. Displaying DataFrame Properties
The project includes printing all DataFrame statistical properties using the describe function.

This step provides useful insights such as:

Count
Mean
Standard deviation
Minimum and maximum values
Quartiles

These metrics help in understanding and summarizing the dataset.

### 4. Modifying Data Type of the Level Column
The data type of the "Level" column was converted to a double (float) to ensure accurate numerical analysis and consistency across the dataset.

### 5. Displaying the First Four Rows
The first four rows of the DataFrame were printed to give an overview of the initial structure and content of the data.

### 6. Removing Null Rows
All rows that contained only null values were deleted.

This step is essential for data cleaning and ensuring that the dataset is ready for analysis.

## Summary
This project provides practical experience with key Pandas functionalities, including:

Creating and managing DataFrames

Understanding data through descriptive statistics

Handling data types

Viewing specific rows

Cleaning data by removing null rows

It serves as a simple and effective 
introduction to using Pandas for data analysis.
